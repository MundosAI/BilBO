Drawing inspiration from Sam Altman's declaration, which underscores the importance of new ideas rather than simply relying on larger models for the future progress of AI, BiLBO introduces a groundbreaking open-source architecture. This architecture is specifically designed for training language models (LMs) and leverages Cross-Device Federated Learning (FL) and Differential Privacy (DP) techniques. What sets BiLBO apart is its ability to operate within a decentralized framework, where siloed datasets are utilized, empowering AI advancements while preserving data privacy and security.
